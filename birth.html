        <h2>Birth</h2>
        <p>
            According to myth, Zeus was the last of the six children born to the Titans Cronus and Rhea. He came into being
            at a chaotic and uncertain time: Cronus had just seized control of the heavens from his father Uranus, one of
            the primordial deities and the overlord of the sky.
    
            Fearing that his own children would usurp him (just as he had his father), Cronus ate his first five
            children—Hestia, Demeter, Hera, Hades, and Poseidon. Determined to save her next child, Rhea stole away while
            she was pregnant with Zeus and delivered him in secret.
    
            Rhea entrusted the child to her mother Gaia, the primordial goddess of the earth, who hid him in a cave. To
            complete this deception, Rhea returned with a stone wrapped in swaddling blankets and gave it to Cronus, who
            devoured it as he had the others. The ruse was thus a success.
    
            In the most familiar version of the myth, Zeus was born on the island of Crete, but ancient sources often
            disagreed on the exact location of the cave in which he was hidden. According to Hesiod, Zeus was raised on
            Mount Aegaeon, near the Cretan city of Lyctus, but in other accounts he was raised on Mount Dicte or Mount Ida.

        <h2>Infancy</h2>
        <p>
            There are different versions of Zeus’ infancy. In the best-known tradition, he was suckled by the she-goat
            Amalthea while a troop of armed warriors called the Curetes danced and clashed their weapons to conceal the
            baby’s cries from Cronus.
    
            But there were numerous variations on this tradition. In one version, Rhea entrusted Zeus to her sister Themis
            rather than Gaia, and Themis in turn entrusted Zeus to a nymph named Amalthea, whose goat it was that nursed the
            infant.
    
            In another variant, Zeus was nursed by the daughters of a certain Melisseus (named as Adrasteia and Ida in some
            sources). In still other traditions, Zeus was fed by various other animals, such as bees or a sow.
    
            Another story told of how Amalthea—a nymph in this tradition—devised a cunning plan to prevent Cronus from
            finding Zeus. Since Cronus ruled the earth, the heavens, and the sea, Amalthea hid the young Zeus by hanging his
            cradle from a tree: suspended between the three realms, Zeus was invisible to Cronus.
    
            Zeus’ childhood is conveyed through a number of colorful myths. In one, a band of Cretan bandits snuck into
            Zeus’ cave to steal the honey of the sacred bees that fed the young god. Zeus caught them and used his power to
            split their armor. He would have killed them, too, but Themis and the Moirae reminded him that it was forbidden
            for anyone to die on sacred ground. Zeus thus changed them into birds instead.
    
            In another myth, Cronus came to Crete in search of Zeus, but Zeus outwitted his father by transforming himself
            into a snake and his nurses into bears. This act of deception was commemorated in the constellations of the
            Dragon and the Greater and Lesser Bear. Alternatively, Zeus was spirited away to Naxos when Cronus came to
            Crete and spent the rest of his childhood there.
