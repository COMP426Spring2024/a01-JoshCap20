        <img class="left" src="images/zeus.jpg" alt="Zeus">
        <p>Zeus is the king of the gods and the god of the sky, weather, law and order, destiny and fate, and
            kingship.
            He
            is married to Hera and has many children. He is the youngest child of Cronus and Rhea. He was respected as a
            sky father
            who was chief of the gods and assigned roles to the others: "Even the gods who are not his natural children
            address him
            as Father, and all the gods rise in his presence." He was equated with many foreign weather gods, permitting
            Pausanias
            to observe "That Zeus is king in heaven is a saying common to all men".</p>
